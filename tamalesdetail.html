        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the corn husks in a bowl of very hot water for 30 minutes or until softened</li>
            <li>Prepare desired fillings</li>
            <li>Make the tamal dough: In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the lard and 2 tablespoons of broth until fluffy, about 3-5 minutes </li>
            <li>Combine the masa flour, baking powder, salt, and cumin in a separate bowl; stir into the lard mixture and beat well with an electric mixer</li>
            <li>Add the broth, little by little to form a very soft dough. Beat on high speed for several minutes</li>
            <li>Assemble the tamales: Lay a corn husk, glossy side up, on the counter with the wide end at the top</li>
            <li>Scoop about ¬º cup of dough onto the top, center of the corn husk.</li>
            <li>Lay a piece of plastic wrap over the dough and use your hands to press and spread the masa into a thin layer, about ¬º inch thick </li>
            <li>Keep the dough spread along the top half of the corn husk to allow plenty of room to fold the bottom husk up, when its time</li>
            <li>Place 1-2 tablespoons of desired filling in a line down the center of the dough</li>
            <li>Fold in one long side of the husk over the filling. Fold in the other long side, overlapping the first (like folding a brochure). Fold the bottom of the husk up</li>
            <li>Tying tamales (optional): You don‚Äôt have to tie a corn husk string around the tamales--it does take more time and they will hold together without it</li>
            <li>Cook on the stove-top or Instant Pot: Add water to the bottom of your steamer or instant pot. (About 1 cup for IP and a few cups for a steamer pot‚Äîdon‚Äôt fill above the steamer rack.)</li>
            <li>Place tamales standing upright, with their open end up, just tightly enough to keep them standing</li>
            <li>Steamer: Bring water to a boil (in Mexico they would often place a coin at the bottom of thesteamer and when the coin started to tap in the pot you know the water was boiling.)</li>
            <li>Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and steam for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or longer. Check them after 45 minutes</li>
            <li>To test if the tamales are done: Remove one and try to pull the husk off. If the husk pulls away cleanly from the tamale they're done</li>
            <li>If the dough is still sticky or wet looking, cook them for 5-10 minutes longer and try again</li>
            <li>Store leftover tamales in the refrigerator for 5-7 days depending on the freshness of your ingredients</li>
